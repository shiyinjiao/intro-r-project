The Tao that is seen is not the true Tao, until 
you bring fresh toner

With searching comes loss 
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working 
Software is like that

My love is a red, red rose
for the terminal is helpful
however I long for pipettes
